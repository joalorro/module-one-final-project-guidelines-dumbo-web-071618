#Module ONE Final Project#

For our project in the 3rd week of our 15-week web development bootcamp at Flatiron School, we developed a text-based RPG in Ruby that combines features of a traditional RPG with the chance-based combat mechanics of Risk (the board game). Our inspiration was to break the mold of traditional RPG's and have fun in making something that was fun and weird.

Without equipment, your chances of winning fight is incredibly low so in order to progress through the levels, one must purchase gear from the shop defeat enemies and look to purchase more advanced equipment. As you level up, you unlock tiers of available equipment and you start encountering higher level opponents. The goal of the game is to defeat the five boss characters that have been terrorizing the land. Installation instructions below (you can skip the next paragraph to find the instructions).
